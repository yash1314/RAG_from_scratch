## RAG-P: A Retrieval-Augmented Generation Chatbot
#### This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot built from scratch using Python. The chatbot allows users to upload documents, transform them into embeddings, perform similarity searches, and generate context-driven responses using an LLM (Language Model). The application follows a modular structure and uses APIs and models from Hugging Face for document embeddings and answer generation.
